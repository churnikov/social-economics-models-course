#Frank Wolfe implementation

These jupyter notebooks contain implementations of Frank-Wolfe algorithm described on lectures of docent Krylatov A.Y. on applied math department.
"OneDimFrankWolfe" notebook has no practical, but it is curious to see minimization of function.
"Frank Wolfe algorithm" notebook is selfexplanatory inside :)
Hope someone would find it useful.
